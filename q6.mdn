6. What is the significance of Data Modeling and explain the types of data modeling.
Data Modeling is the process of creating a conceptual representation of data and its relationships. It is crucial for designing databases that are efficient, scalable, and meet the application requirements.

Types of Data Modeling:

Conceptual Data Modeling:

Purpose: Provides a high-level overview of the data, focusing on the entities and relationships without detail on how data is stored.
Tools: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD).
Use Case: Initial design phase to identify data requirements and relationships.
Logical Data Modeling:

Purpose: Details the data structures and relationships, focusing on how the data is organized and accessed without considering physical storage.
Tools: Normalized tables, relationships.
Use Case: Refines conceptual models, ensuring data integrity and removing redundancy.
Physical Data Modeling:

Purpose: Specifies how the data will be stored in the database, including table structures, indexes, and constraints.
Tools: Database schema diagrams.
Use Case: Implementation phase to optimize database performance and storage.
