5. List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.
Types of DBMS Classification:

Hierarchical DBMS:

Structure: Data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. Each record has one parent and potentially multiple children.
Example: IBM Information Management System (IMS).
Advantages: Efficient for hierarchical data relationships, such as organizational structures.
Disadvantages: Rigid structure makes it difficult to handle complex queries and reorganize data.
Network DBMS:

Structure: Data is represented in a graph format where records can have multiple parent and child relationships, allowing more complex relationships.
Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).
Advantages: Flexible and supports many-to-many relationships.
Disadvantages: Complexity in design and maintenance; less user-friendly than other models.
Relational DBMS (RDBMS):

Structure: Data is organized in tables (relations) with rows and columns. Tables can be linked using keys.
Example: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.
Advantages: Powerful query capabilities with SQL; supports complex queries, transactions, and data integrity.
Disadvantages: Performance can be affected with very large datasets; complex schema design.
Object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS):

Structure: Data is stored as objects, similar to object-oriented programming. It supports complex data types and relationships.
Example: db4o, ObjectDB.
Advantages: Better integration with object-oriented programming languages; supports complex data models.
Disadvantages: Less mature than RDBMS; fewer standard tools and resources.
NoSQL DBMS:

Structure: Non-relational databases designed for various data models like key-value pairs, documents, columns, or graphs.
Example: MongoDB (document-oriented), Redis (key-value).
Advantages: Scalable, flexible, and suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.
Disadvantages: Limited support for complex queries and transactions; varying consistency models.
