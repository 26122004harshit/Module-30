4. Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage systems that were tackled by DBMS.
Challenges Addressed by DBMS:

Data Redundancy: DBMS reduces redundancy through normalization, which organizes data into related tables and minimizes duplication.
Data Integrity: DBMS enforces data integrity through constraints and rules to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Concurrency Control: DBMS provides mechanisms to handle simultaneous access, preventing conflicts and ensuring data consistency.
Scalability: DBMS supports scaling by optimizing data storage and retrieval processes to handle large volumes of data effectively.
Backup and Recovery: DBMS includes automated tools and processes for backing up data and recovering it in case of failures or data loss.
