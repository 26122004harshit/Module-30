A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It is managed by a Database Management System (DBMS) which allows users to easily store, retrieve, update, and manage data.

Example: Imagine an online retail store. The store uses a database to keep track of products, customers, orders, and inventory. The database might include tables such as:

Products: Contains details about each product (ID, name, price, stock quantity).
Customers: Stores customer information (ID, name, address, contact details).
Orders: Records order details (Order ID, customer ID, product IDs, order date, total amount).
Why we need a database:

Efficient Data Management: Databases provide a systematic way to manage large volumes of data.
Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
Security: Protects data from unauthorized access.
Data Retrieval: Allows fast and flexible querying and reporting.
Concurrency Control: Manages multiple users accessing the data simultaneously.
