2. Write a short note on File-based storage systems. Explain the major challenges of a File-based storage system.
File-based Storage Systems involve storing data in files within a filesystem. Data is organized in flat files or folders, with each file holding records and fields.

Major Challenges:

Data Redundancy: Data might be duplicated across multiple files, leading to inefficiency and inconsistencies.
Data Integrity: Ensuring data consistency and accuracy is challenging without constraints and validation rules.
Concurrency Issues: Managing simultaneous access and updates to files can lead to conflicts and corruption.
Scalability: As the volume of data grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage and organize files effectively.
Backup and Recovery: Implementing reliable backup and recovery procedures is complex and prone to errors.
